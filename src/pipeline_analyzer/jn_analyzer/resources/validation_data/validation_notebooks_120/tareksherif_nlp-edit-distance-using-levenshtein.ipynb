Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question. In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T.\n\nDifferent definitions of an edit distance use different sets of string operations. Levenshtein distance operations are the removal, insertion, or substitution of a character in the string. Being the most common metric, the term Levenshtein distance is often used interchangeably with edit distance.[1]"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://github.com/TarekSherif/NoteBookImages/raw/master/edit-distance/1.svg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://github.com/TarekSherif/NoteBookImages/raw/master/edit-distance/2.ppm)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing the necessary Libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from Levenshtein import distance\nimport numpy as np\n","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# function definition"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndef get_distance_matrix(str_list):\n    \"\"\" Construct a levenshtein distance matrix for a list of strings\"\"\"\n    dist_matrix = np.zeros(shape=(len(str_list), len(str_list)))\n\n    print (\"Starting to build distance matrix.
