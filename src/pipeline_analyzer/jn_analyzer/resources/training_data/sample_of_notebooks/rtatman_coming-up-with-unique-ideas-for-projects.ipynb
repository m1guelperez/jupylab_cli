Start with a dataset (I like to go to the datasets listing & sort by recently updated. Then pick one without a lot of anlyses on it.)\n    * Google's dataset search: https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch \n2. Look over the dataset\n    * Think about what questions you could answer with this\n    * If it were data from someone's business, what would they want to know about it? \n    * What needs to be done to the data before you can analyze it (data cleaning)? Can you show off your abilty to handle tricky problems?\n3. If you like, look at analyses on similar types of datasets\n4. Exploratory data anlaysis\n\nEither: \n\n5. Find the most interesting thing in the anlysis & expand on it (including other related datasets)\n6. Build your story around the interesting finding, making sure to answer the question \"so what? why is this important?\" \n\nOR: \n\n5. Find a technique that is usually applied to this sort of problem & apply it\n6.
