    "For this tutorial, we're going to be guessing which author wrote a string of text based on the normalized unigram frequency. That's just a fancy way of saying that we're going to count how often each author uses every word in our training data and then divide by the number of total words they wrote. Then, if our test sentence has words that we've seen one author use a lot more than the others, we will guess that that person is probably the author.\n",
