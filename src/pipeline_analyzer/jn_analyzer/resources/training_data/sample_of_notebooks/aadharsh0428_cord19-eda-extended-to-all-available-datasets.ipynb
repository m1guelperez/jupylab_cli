      "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a highly p revalent cause of the acute respiratory infection (ARI) defined as the common cold [1, 2, 3] , which is frequently associated in children with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, wheezing, pneumonia, asthma and otitis [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . HRVs are classified in genus Enterovirus (HEVs) in family Picornaviridae [10] . HRVs are non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses of approximately 7200 nt, composed of a 59 untranslated region (UTR), followed by a long open reading frame coding for capsid proteins VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1, and seven non-structural proteins 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D, and terminated by a short 39UTR and poly A tract.More than 100 serotypes of HRV are known, which have been classified into two species, HRV-A and HRV-B, according to comparative alignment of nucleotide fragments of VP1 [11, 12] , VP4/VP2 [13] and 59UTR [14, 15] , and more recently, on complete genome nucleotide sequences [16] . Moreover, some genomic sequences have been found not to cluster with HRV-A and HRV-B species, which suggests the existence of other species (HRV-C and HRV-D) [16] . A new species of HRV-C was recently identified worldwide by comparative analysis of VP4 or VP4/VP2 genes [7, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and 59UTR [14, 15] .However, discrepancies have appeared in the classification of some of the new HRV-A or HRV-C strains, depending on the size and location of the nucleotide sequence in the viral genome and on the phylogenetic methods used for direct analysis of HRV sequences [3, 7, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23] .These recent data underline the lack of knowledge about the biodiversity of HRV strains and their worldwide distribution [14, 17] . Moreover, little is known about the characteristics and diversity of HRVs circulating in a given area in a short period of time. In the present study, we looked for HRVs in a 2-year collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of children with ARI visiting a district hospital in Shanghai, and compared sequences in two regions previously defined for genetic classification of HRV serotypes [13, 15] . Our study showed a high diversity of HRV species and genotypes, and a prevalence of the novel HRV-C species in NPSs of children with bronchitis and pneumonia. This biodiversity appeared to result partly from recombination events in the 59UTR, between HRV-C strains and those close or similar to HRV-A species, which led to the suggested classification of HRV-C into at least two subspecies.\n",

Unfortunately, the immune system of dairy cows becomes depressed during the periparturient period (Kehrli et al., 1989a, b) , causing them to be less able to respond to challenges (Cai et al., 1994) . In addition, sufficient passive transfer of immunity to the calf may be jeopardized if cows are not able to transfer enough Ig into colostrum to provide adequate colostrum quality (Stott and Fellah, 1983; Rea et al., 1996) . For instance, Perino et al. (1995) reported that calves born to dams with mastitis had lower plasma protein and IgG concentrations at 10 and 24 h after birth compared with calves born to dams without mastitis.Diseases such as mastitis in periparturient cows and scours in calves decrease performance and may require the use of therapeutic agents. Greater than 62% of deaths in calves are attributed to diarrhea or other digestive problems (NAHMS, 2003) .

Alternative products are needed that may demonstrate performance, health, and economic benefits similar to those provided by antibiotics. Feed supplements that can decrease the use of antibiotics while enhancing immune function and passive transfer of immunity are needed to help dairy cows meet the challenges of the periparturient period and aid in survival of their offspring. Examples of dietary factors that can influence immune function range from energy and protein to micronutrients such as vitamins A and E and trace minerals (Goff and Stabel, 1990; Hogan et al., 1992; Franklin et al., 1998) .Mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) has enhanced performance, improved immune function, and inhibited colonization of the digestive tract by unfavorable microorganisms in a number of livestock species.

      "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a pathological process primarily caused by interrupted local blood circulation, which can cause apoptosis of osteocytes and osseous tissue necrosis (1, 2) . The lack of effective therapy for ONFH is a difficulty that needs to be overcome in clinical practice. Several methods have been used to treat early-stage ONFH, such as drug therapy, core decompression, vascularized bone grafting and rotational osteotomy. However, the clinical results of these methods are not satisfactory (3, 4) .Previous studies have described the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to promote local bone repair and healing (5, 6) . MSCs are pluripotent and can differentiate into several lineages of cells, which have shown potency in the treatment of numerous ischemic diseases, such as myocardial infarction (7, 8) , nerve injury (9) and bone defect (10) . Prior studies have found that the implantation of MSCs into the necrotic area of the femoral head was able to improve local bone regeneration (11, 12) . MSCs are able to differentiate into osteoblasts to promote local bone healing directly (13, 14) . Furthermore, MSCs are able to secrete growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin 1, stromal cell-derived factor 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, which have angiogenic potency and can promote local revascularization, thereby improving bone healing indirectly (15, 16) .Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key mediator of the adaptive cell response to hypoxia, which controls the expression of numerous genes and modulates cell proliferation, differentiation and pluripotency (17) . Previous experiments have suggested that HIF-1α could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and the expression of angiogenic factors, thus promoting their bone healing capacity (18) . In a prior study, we implanted HIF-1α transgenic MSCs into the necrotic area of the femoral head, and found that this treatment resulted in improved osteogenic and angiogenic capacity in vitro and in vivo, leading to better results for early-stage ONFH (19) . However, the risks of lentivirus vectors, such as tumorigenesis (20) , should be seriously considered before clinical application.Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) is a cell permeable prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor, which is able to stabilize expression of HIF-1α in cells at normal oxygen tension (21) . Therefore, DMOG is hypothesized to be an alternative strategy for enhancing HIF-1α expression in MSCs. In a previous study, we demonstrated that DMOG could increase HIF-1α expression in MSCs, accordingly enhancing their bone healing capacity (22) . In the present study, we investigated whether DMOG was able to enhance the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in treating early-stage ONFH.\n",
