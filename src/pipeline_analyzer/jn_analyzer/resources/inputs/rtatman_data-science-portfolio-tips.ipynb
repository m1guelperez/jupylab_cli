"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5a3bd735a532333c846759f8515decbdca7fedf6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Highlighting knowledge**\n\nWhat type of job do you want? \n\nIf you want to be building systems/engineering/building pipelines (more on the **machine learning engineering side**) then focus on building end-to-end projects. Show that you can:\n\n* Come up with good/new ideas (not the place for Titanic!)\n* Finish projects that work (build a working prototype)\n* Clearly articulate the value of what you've built to a non-data-scientist (<- super important!)\n\nIf you're looking for more of an analysis/data storytelling/measurement/A/B testing job (more like **analytics**) then you need to show:\n\n* That you can find new information in data\n* That you can succinctly communicate that information to a variety of stakeholders (i.e. people who care)\n\n> Communication is very, very important no matter what role you play. Put your portfolio together keeping in mind that both technical & non-technical people will read it.\n\n___\n\nQualities of a good portfolio: \n\n* Diverse (you don't need to show every project on every application, but having a lot of kinds of projects will help you apply to more jobs).  I would recommend:\n  * A text-based project\n  * An image project\n  * Time series analysis\n  * Some sort of A/B testing/hypothesis testing\n  * A visualization project\n  * A geo/mapping project\n  * A really intense data cleaning project (multiple datasets, missing data that requires imputation)\n  * Regression analysis\n  * Something that uses SQL\n* Show that you can work in a reproducible way & follow (some) software engineering best practices\n  * Version/source control (git, I reccomend this guide: http://happygitwithr.com/)\n  * Not putting everything in one big Jupyter/R Markdown file. Put functions in a seperate file and import them, split data cleaning and data analysis/modelling.\n  * Use a linter/follow a style guide (e.g. PEP8 for Python, Tidyverse style guide for R)\n* Work that is to the point. I personally would avoid large exploratory data analysis projects in your portfolio.\n* Clear explanatory text. What did you, why did you do it and why is it important? If you use a particularly unusual technique, can you explain it and show that it preforms better than some baseline (e.g. regression)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d471f0c703a69e95f8004150f97a58c0e3ac7263"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"448155baa6048f6f24c23fb9c529ec208d8579b9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ba4e29d1d60917dbe4e004bc42186c3ca8d62b46"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"25713384ae0bb4a4efbbafbbf44dfeb2f3cb5626"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
